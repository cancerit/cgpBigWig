# CHANGES

## NEXT

- First full release
- Add overlapping reads support to `bam2bw`, `bam2bwbases` and `bam2bedgraph` via commandline flag `--overlap` `-a`
  - If the same readname is encountered twice at a position it is considred an overlapping read pair.
  - Where the same base [ACGT] was encountered on each of the reads it will only be counted once. If a different base was encountered then the coverage count is incremented once for each base.
