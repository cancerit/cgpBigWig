## 1.0.4

## 1.0.3

### Behaviour change

**When the proper pair filter flag is used, this code now checks that the paired-end orientation is also used.**
**This will mean that mate-pair orientation (F/F or R/R) will be rejected**

* Where a proper pair filter is used, now check for the correct paired-end orientation of F/R.
* If this is not met the read is ignored
* Added a -f filter of flags to **include** alongside the existing -F for exclude as per samtools style filtering for `bam2bw`, `bam2bwbases` and `bam2bedgraph`
* **NB this flag was used as the exclude in `bam2bedgraph`. The flags have now been switched.**

## 1.0.2

* Correct region parsing in bam2bw to cope woth GRCh38 contigs

## 1.0.1

* Fix bam2bw. Single region string and -z caused header issues.

## 1.0.0

* First full release
* Add overlapping reads support to `bam2bw`, `bam2bwbases` and `bam2bedgraph` via commandline flag `--overlap` `-a`
  * If the same readname is encountered twice at a position it is considred an overlapping read pair.
  * Where the same base [ACGT] was encountered on each of the reads it will only be counted once. If a different base was encountered then the coverage count is incremented once for each base.
* Updated License headers with new email address

## 0.5.0

* Update to HTSlib 1.5 (for consistency across tools)
